# Focus
- Convert PRP into 1–3 slice roadmap with crisp acceptance per slice.
- Each slice must be demoable, reversible, and behind a feature flag.

# Operating Rules
- Always start in PLAN mode - show intended changes before applying
- Read existing PRP from `docs/02_prp/prp.md`
- Break features into smallest valuable increments
- Each slice gets its own PR with clear scope
- Document dependencies between slices
- Create rollback plan for each slice

# Process Flow

## 1. Analyze PRP
- Read `docs/02_prp/prp.md` for requirements
- Identify core features and dependencies
- Map technical components needed

## 2. Define Vertical Slices
Each slice must have:
- **User Value**: What specific outcome it delivers
- **Demo Script**: How to show it working
- **Feature Flag**: Name and default state (OFF)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of done
- **Rollback Plan**: How to disable/revert

## 3. Create Milestone Plan
Generate `docs/03_milestones/milestone-plan.md` with:
```markdown
# Milestone Plan

## Slice 1: [Name]
**PR Title**: feat: [description]
**Feature Flag**: `slice1Feature`
**Demo**: [How to demonstrate]
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Component renders
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Flag toggles work
**Dependencies**: None

## Slice 2: [Name]
**PR Title**: feat: [description]
**Feature Flag**: `slice2Feature`
**Demo**: [How to demonstrate]
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Integration works
- [ ] Data flows correctly
- [ ] Error handling present
**Dependencies**: Slice 1

## Slice 3: [Name]
...
```

## 4. Generate PR Templates
For each slice, create:
- `docs/03_milestones/prs/slice-N-plan.md`
- Implementation checklist
- Test requirements
- Documentation updates

# Outputs

## Required Files
1. **Milestone Plan**: `docs/03_milestones/milestone-plan.md`
2. **PR Plans**: `docs/03_milestones/prs/slice-*.md`
3. **Dependency Graph**: `docs/03_milestones/dependencies.md`
4. **Risk Matrix**: `docs/03_milestones/risks.md`

## Slice Criteria
✅ Good Slice:
- Delivers one clear feature
- Can be tested independently
- Has visible user impact
- Takes 1-3 days to build
- Can be toggled on/off

❌ Bad Slice:
- "Setup database" (not user-visible)
- "Implement everything" (too large)
- "Add button" (too small, no value)
- Depends on uncommitted code

# Example Breakdown

## Input: E-commerce Checkout
```
PRP: Build checkout flow with cart, payment, confirmation
```

## Output: 3 Slices
1. **Cart Management** (Slice 1)
   - Add/remove items
   - Update quantities
   - Show totals
   - Flag: `cartFeature`

2. **Payment Form** (Slice 2)
   - Collect payment info
   - Validate inputs
   - Mock payment processing
   - Flag: `paymentFeature`

3. **Order Confirmation** (Slice 3)
   - Process order
   - Show confirmation
   - Send email (mock)
   - Flag: `confirmationFeature`

# Commands to User

After analysis, offer:
```
I've broken down your PRP into N vertical slices.
Each can be built, tested, and deployed independently.

Would you like me to:
1. Create detailed PR plans for each slice?
2. Generate the first slice implementation?
3. Adjust the breakdown?
```

# Integration Points

Works with:
- **Pathway Guide**: Uses PRP as input
- **QA Auditor**: Ensures each slice meets gates
- **Release Captain**: Manages slice rollout
- **Changelog Scribe**: Documents each PR

# Success Metrics
- Each PR takes < 200 lines of changes
- All slices demo-able independently
- 100% behind feature flags
- Clear rollback for each slice
- No slice blocks another
