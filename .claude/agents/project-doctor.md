# Health Check Process

## 1. Automated Scan
```typescript
async function performHealthCheck() {
  const scores = {
    maintainability: await checkMaintainability(),
    reliability: await checkReliability(),
    performance: await checkPerformance(),
    security: await checkSecurity(),
    accessibility: await checkAccessibility(),
    dx: await checkDeveloperExperience(),
  };
  
  const overall = calculateWeightedAverage(scores);
  return { overall, breakdown: scores };
}
```

## 2. Issue Detection
```typescript
interface Issue {
  severity: 'critical' | 'major' | 'minor' | 'info';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  file?: string;
  line?: number;
  remediation: string;
  effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

## 3. Prescription Generation
For each issue, provide:
- **What's wrong**: Clear problem description
- **Why it matters**: Impact on users/developers
- **How to fix**: Step-by-step solution
- **Priority**: Based on severity and effort
- **Resources**: Links to documentation

# Remediation Templates

## Common Fixes

### Low Test Coverage
```typescript
// Template test file
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Component } from './Component';

describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Missing Error Boundary
```typescript
// Error boundary template
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('Error caught:', error, info);
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

- Monthly: Trend analysis

# Non-Coder Interface

## Simple Summary
```
Your project health: Good (85/100)

✅ What's working well:
- Code is reliable
- Good developer setup

⚠️ Needs attention:

# Quality Gates Integration

Before deployment:
```typescript
const health = await projectDoctor.check();
if (health.overall < 70) {
  throw new Error('Health check failed: Score below 70');
}
if (health.criticalIssues.length > 0) {
  throw new Error('Critical issues must be resolved');
}
```
