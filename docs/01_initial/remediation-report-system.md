# Remediation Report System - Project Specification

## Business Overview
**Company**: Water, Fire, and Mould Remediation Business  
**Location**: Brisbane, Queensland, Australia  
**Service Area**: 98% Queensland, occasional interstate claims  
**Core Service**: Investigation, causation analysis, and comprehensive reporting

## System Purpose
Create an intelligent report writing system that produces factually accurate, thoroughly researched, and citation-backed remediation reports that go beyond standard reporting to provide exceptional value to clients and insurers.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Investigation & Analysis
- **Causation Analysis**: Determine root causes of water, fire, and mould damage
- **IAQ Assessments**: Indoor Air Quality testing and analysis
- **Laboratory Integration**: Process and interpret external lab results
- **HVAC Analysis**: Airflow, ventilation, and contamination spread assessment
- **Material Analysis**: Building materials, contents, and personal property evaluation

### 2. Compliance & Standards
- **IICRC Standards**: S500 (Water), S520 (Mould), S700 (Fire/Smoke)
- **Australian Standards**: AS/NZS standards for building and remediation
- **Queensland Regulations**: State-specific building codes and health regulations
- **Insurance Guidelines**: Policy interpretation and coverage assessment
- **WHS Requirements**: Workplace Health and Safety considerations

### 3. Constraint Management
- **Insurance Coverage**: Policy limitations and claimable items
- **Scope Limitations**: Authority levels, make-safe only, staged approvals
- **Third-Party Coordination**: Other trades, specialists, authorities
- **Health Considerations**: Occupant health conditions and sensitivities
- **Access & Security**: Site accessibility and security requirements

### 4. Advanced Reporting Features
- **Holistic Assessment**: Look beyond visible damage
- **Secondary Damage Prevention**: Proactive recommendations
- **Restoration vs Replacement**: Cost-benefit analysis favoring restoration
- **Emotional Impact Consideration**: Sentimental value assessment
- **Alternative Solutions**: Creative problem-solving within constraints
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: All suggestions backed by standards/citations

## Report Components

### Standard Sections
1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Scope of Investigation**
3. **Observations & Findings**
4. **Causation Analysis**
5. **Risk Assessment**
6. **Recommendations**
7. **Supporting Documentation**
8. **References & Standards**

### Specialized Assessments
- **Mould Risk Matrix**: Spread potential, health risks, containment needs
- **HVAC Contamination Assessment**: System impact and remediation requirements
- **Contents Restoration Viability**: Item-by-item restoration potential
- **Secondary Damage Prevention Plan**: Proactive mitigation strategies
- **Health & Safety Protocols**: Site-specific safety requirements

## Key Differentiators
1. **Restoration-First Mindset**: Prioritize restoration over replacement
2. **Comprehensive Scope**: Consider all affected systems, not just visible damage
3. **Citation-Heavy**: Every recommendation backed by standards/guidelines
4. **Risk Mitigation Focus**: Prevent secondary damage and future issues
5. **Client-Centric**: Consider emotional, financial, and time impacts
6. **Beyond Qualification Awareness**: Recognize when specialists are needed

- Restoration vs replacement ratio

## Example Use Case: Mould in Ducted AC Property

### Standard Approach
- Identify visible mould
- Recommend cleaning affected area
- Basic containment

### Our Enhanced Approach
- Identify visible mould
- Assess HVAC system for contamination spread
- Map potential affected zones through ductwork
- Recommend:
  - Immediate HVAC shutdown (IICRC S520 12.2.2)
  - Seal all vents (AS/NZS 4849.1:2003)
  - HVAC specialist inspection (AIRAH guidelines)
  - Whole-house air quality testing (WHO guidelines)
  - Containment strategy for all connected zones
  - Post-remediation verification protocol
- Consider occupant health sensitivities
- Provide restoration timeline with minimal disruption
- Document sentimental items for priority restoration

## Integration Points
- Laboratory LIMS systems
- Insurance claim platforms
- Building code databases
- Weather/environmental data
- Industry standards libraries
- Photo documentation tools

## Compliance Library
- IICRC: S500, S520, S540, S700, S750
- AS/NZS: 4849.1, 3666, 1668.2
- Queensland Building Codes
- Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld)
- Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld)
- Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth)

This system will revolutionize remediation reporting by providing comprehensive, factual, and actionable documentation that serves all stakeholders while prioritizing restoration and prevention of secondary damage.
