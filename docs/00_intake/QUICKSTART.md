# ðŸš€ Quick Start with Pathway Guide

## Launch Instructions

### 1. Open in Claude Code
```powershell
# Launch Claude Code in plan mode with Wizard context
Write-Host "Open this folder in Claude Code. Then select the 'Pathway Guide' agent and paste the BUILD PROMPT (Wizard)."
```

### 2. Select the Pathway Guide Agent
In Claude Code:
1. Open the folder containing this project
2. Look for the agent selector (usually in the sidebar or menu)
3. Select **"Pathway Guide"** from the available agents

### 3. Start the Wizard
The Pathway Guide will greet you with:
> **"What is your project? Tell me as much as you can."**

### 4. What Happens Next
Your answers will be:
- Saved to `docs/00_intake/sessions/S-[DATE]-[slug].md`
- Converted into a Project Requirements Plan (PRP)
- Used to generate your first vertical slice
- Turned into testable, deployable code

## The Bootstrap Wizard Process

The Pathway Guide will ask you these questions:
1. **Project Vision** - What are you building?
2. **Primary User** - Who uses it and why?
3. **MVP Outcome** - What proves it works?
4. **Must-haves** - Essential v1 features
5. **Nice-to-haves** - Future additions
6. **Constraints** - Technical requirements
7. **Out of Scope** - What v1 won't do
8. **Milestones** - Key dates
9. **Risks** - Unknown challenges
10. **Success Metrics** - How to measure success

## Output Structure

After the Q&A session, you'll have:
```
